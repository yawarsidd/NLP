# NLP
The emails are available as a dataset in which some are spam and some are not spam. The objective of the project is to create a classification model that helped in  predicting whether the emails are spam or not.

The key steps are followed in that project are:-

1. Importing Nltk and textblob libraries.
2. Cleaning the text data by using some regular expressions.
3. Spelling correction using TextBlob.
4. Use of Lemmatizer, Stemming, Removal of Stopwords, Named Entity Recognition, etc.
5. Visualization of the words by WordClouds
6. Vectorizing the email data into numerical form by using Countvectorizer, Term Frequency Inverse document Frequency (TFIDF Vectorizer)
7. Machine learning algorithms that are used in predicting whether it is spam or not is Naive Bayes and KNN
8. Naive Bayes gets higher accuracy on the test dataset i.e 97.54 %
